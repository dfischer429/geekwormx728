Python 3 Script for Geekworm X728 Raspberry Pi UPS Hat 
The original script provided by Geekworm for their X728 model UPS hat is written in Python 2, and in my experience would not run properly in certain Linux distributions. I converted the script to Python 3 specifically to run in Kali Linux on a Raspberry Pi 4. 
Install instructions for the X728 can be found here: https://wiki.geekworm.com/X728-Software
